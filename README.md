# Usage for Power Sweep Data:

1. Update `metainfo.json`
2. Update `attenuation.json`
3. Run `python HMM_PowerSweep.py` or `jupyter-notebook HMM_PowerSweep.ipynb`

# Usage for Flux-Power Swepp Data:



## To Do:

- [ ] Automate the determination for attenuation below which the system is non-linear
- [ ] Automate extraction of means
- [ ] Better algorithm for `covariances`
